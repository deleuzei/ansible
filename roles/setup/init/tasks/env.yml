    # You might be alarmed at the use of NOPASSWD for sudo privileges. After all, aren’t passwords always more secure?
    # Well, there are many cases (especially in automation, if you don’t have interactive logins for service accounts) where the convenience of not requiring a password for sudo use outweighs the minimal security benefit of requiring a password for all sudo activity.
    # For a good balance of convenience and security, you can also apply NOPASSWD to only a specific set of commands an account should be able to run without a password.
